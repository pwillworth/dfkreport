    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Lila's Ledger contains helpful transaction history for your wallet across DFKChain, Klaytn, and Harmony networks.</h3>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">General Usage</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Just put in your wallet address at the top on the homepage, adjust blockchain and date options if needed to get started.</li>
        <li>If you are not a member, or have not used the site recently, a table will appear saying your wallet data is not updated, otherwise, select a report to view.</li>
        <li>Instead of viewing a report, you can also choose CSV Export on the left to just export your transaction data in your preferred format.</li>
        <li>If you have a lot of transactions as is the case with many DFK wallets, the data update process can take a very long time the first time.  You can leave the site and check back on progress the next day.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Report Options</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Date Range: Only events in this range will be included in the report.  Older transactions will still be searched to look for cost basis.</li>
        <li>Blockchain icons: click to include/exclude data from that chain before you generate.</li>
        <li>CSV Format: Displayed when you click CSV Export button, select the format for the system you plan to import the data to.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Token Swaps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>View your performance on recent token trades.</li>
        <li>For each token trade you do, a cost basis is found for the most recent trades where you acquired that token to determine a gain/loss</li>
        <li>The top of the report summarizes all of the gains and losses, separating values where full cost basis was not found.</li>
        <li>Some tokens may not have cost basis found, or use very old cost basis if you acquire the tokens by other means like questing, transfering in from elsewhere, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Crafting</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>View your performance on recent crafted item sales.</li>
        <li>For each craftable item trade you do, a cost basis is found for the most recent crafting activity or trades where you acquired that item to determine a gain/loss</li>
        <li>The top of the report summarizes all of the gains and losses, separating values where full cost basis was not found.</li>
        <li>Some tokens may not have cost basis found, or use very old cost basis if you acquire the tokens by other means like questing, transfering in from elsewhere, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Hero/Pet Sales</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>View your performance on recent Hero/Pet sales.</li>
        <li>For each NFT sale you do, a cost basis is found for the NFT from all NFT activity on it you did such as summon costs, level ups, purchase, etc. and a gain or loss is calculated.</li>
        <li>The top of the report summarizes all of the gains and losses, separating values where full cost basis was not found.</li>
        <li>Cost Basis is considered full if a purchase or summon cost was found for the hero.</li>
        <li>Some NFTs may not have cost basis found, typically if you acquired it on a different wallet you did not include on the report.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Duels</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>View your summarized DFK Duels activity.</li>
        <li>A summary is shown of all Duels Fees you paid and Rewards you got for the basic Duel fights.</li>
        <li>A summary of all of the Airdrops you claimed during the period is shown as well, which will include your Duels tier rewards or raffle wins.</li>
        <li>Note: If you claim other airdrops from non-Duels contests, they will show here as well.</li>
        <li>Detailed transaction list of the summarized data is also shown below it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Transactions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Just a detailed list of all wallet transactions grouped by type.</li>
        <li>NFTs: All records related to hero, pet and land NFTs like buy/sell/hire, perish, summon, enhance, and level up.  For pet hatching transactions, power token costs are associated with the 'incubate' event, and all other item costs including the egg itself are associated to the 'crack' event.</li>
        <li>Trader: Records of swaps make with trader or vendor in marketplace.</li>
        <li>Bazaar: Records of trades made on Bazaar.</li>
        <li>Liquidity: Records of swapping for LP seeds from the druid, and Entering and Withdrawing from liquidity pools.</li>
        <li>Gardens: Events of claiming rewards from your LP seeds in the gardens.</li>
        <li>Bank: Records of your bank deposits and withdrawals.</li>
        <li>Crafting: Any crafting you have done at the Alchemist or Stone Carver.</li>
        <li>Quests: All of your rewards from sending heroes on quests. NOTE: If your date range is greater than 1 week, this will be empty.  If you want long periods of quest data, please do a CSV export.</li>
        <li>Wallet: Any miscellanous transfers to/from your wallet to non-game related addresses.</li>
        <li>Airdrop: Any Jewel airdrops you have received.</li>
        <li>Lending: Records of lending and borrowing tokens on Tranquil Finance.  Note that interest paid and recieved through this platform is not recorded in the Tax Report income.  Also, when liqudations are recorded, the token listed is what you paid to liquidate a position.  The token you recieved for the liquidation will show up as a redeem transaction when you redeem it because you recieve the asset as actively lended.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Legacy Tax Report</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You can still find the old original tax gains report, but it is of limited use considering the variety of tax juristictions, you are betting off importing your transactions to real tax software.</li>
        <li>Tax reporting requirements vary in different areas, but this report is meant to help you with accounting for things that are commonly required.</li>
        <li>The Capital Gains section will list detected NFT and Token Sales, and attempt to calculate the cost basis/gains for them where possible.</li>
        <li>The Income section will list detected events that are commonly categorized as income like bank interest and rewards.</li>
        <li>If you see the warning icon <img src="{{ BASE_SCRIPT_URL }}static/images/alertred.png" style="height:16px;"/> in the costs column on the tax report, it means that Lila could not find a source for all of the cost basis of that item.  You can find more details in the CSV export to see how much it was partially accounted if any.</li>
        <li>Cost basis for NFT sales will be set by adding up any costs you have incurred for that NFT including Purchasing it, summoning it, or leveling it up.</li>
        <li>If cost basis for tokens sales is not found in the history of other swaps, other wallet transfers that are detected will be used to fill in remaining cost basis if possible.  Keep in mind that the price of those transferred tokens is calculated as of the time they were transferred to your address which is accurate if you purchased them that day.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Price Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Fiat Values are calculated based on token price at the end of day when the event happened.</li>
        <li>Prices are sourced from Coin Gecko first if available, otherwise they are looked up from DexScreener and if all else fails, the current price of the item is looked up from the Dex Contract on chain if available.</li>
        <li>Take prices of non-denominational items like eggs and stones with a grain of salt as dex prices for them can be weird in low liquidity situations so automated pricing is often not feasible.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="helpTopic">Membership</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>On the <a href="{{ BASE_SCRIPT_URL }}/members">Members</a> page, you can define wallet groups and find and view past reports you have run.</li>
        <li>You can only use features on the members page if you are currently subscribed.  After connecting your wallet and logging in, you can purchase a subscription.</li>
        <li>The left pane of the members page shows you how much time is left in your subscription, and provides tools to help you make a payment to add time.</li>
    </ul>
