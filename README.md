# Lila's Ledger
Lila works hard at Serendale Bank make sure all the people of the kingdoms can get an accurate accounting of thier activity in Defi Kingdoms.
Currently hosted here for review by the community: [Lilas Ledger](https://dfkreport.cognifact.com)

## Components
This Python web application provides a way for anyone to enter thier Blockchain wallet address and get a report of thier transactions in the Defi Kingdoms game over a date range, as well as a report detailing cost basis accounting of crypto assets sold to show the net gains realized from the value when acquired vs. when sold/traded.

To facilitate this, the server side communicates with the blockchain to get all of the transactions for a wallet address, then parse the details of all of those transactions to interpret the events and produce the financial report.  Once a particular transaction has been parsed, it is saved in a MariaDB for quicker access if that transaction is ever needed by another request in the future.  The complete results of requested reports are also saved for quick retrieval without the need for parsing if the same report is requested.

Another server side component to keep in mind is that a process must run at a regular interval to parse any transactions for the Tavern Hero Sales and Hires.  This is due to the fact that transactions where a wallet gets paid for a hero auction or hire are not associated to the sellers transaction history, just the buyers and the auction house.  The blockCrawler.py utility should be setup to run at some regular interval which populates any new hero sales so they will be included in any reports that are run for a wallet that had sales.

## Bounty Parameters
Here outlines the bounty application needs and how they are met by Lila's Ledger:

### Generate a complete transaction history report for any wallet over any customized time frame
The complete history is available on the "Transactions" tab after generation
### Account for every smart contract transaction in the game with a clear line item that is tagged with transaction type and whether this was awarded via a quest, payment, sell of hero, and the price change when sold relative to when received
The relevant received vs. sold price change is found on the "Tax Report" tab after generation
### Quantify all gains and losses for the wallet address entered
The gains and losses are quantified on the "Tax Report" tab, there is also summarized amounts of all transactions on the "Summary" tab for those details that might not be tax relevant.
### Have a mechanism for easily adding all new DFK smart contracts as they are released
The application utilizes a plain datafile containing a dictionary of all DFK smart contracts that can be easily added to.
### Be able to track transactions across multiple EVM based blockchains
The strategy utilized by this submission utlizes blockchain explorer endpoints to retrieve the transaction list for a wallet, then all other interaction is done through a generic web3 sdk which would be agnostic to the EVM chain.  In this setup, addition of each new blockchain to DFK would just require a minimal code update to fetch the transactions for that chain as well to be fed in to the larger program.
### Bonus points for accommodating other currencies than USD 
I kept this in mind during development, and engineered things in such a way as the fiat currency is always parameterized so it would be easier to add in later, but at this time everything is defaulted to USD.  Later enhancement could be done to build out the interface components for currency selection and enhancement of price lookup mechanisms to convert for it, but it is not capable at the time of submission/deadline.

### Extra bonus
This is not called out in the bounty, but I thought it might be useful to include a feature for different cost basis calculation methods, so that is added as a bonus feature for the report options.  Another bonus is inclusion of some fun facts on the Summary tab people might like.  Everyone probably wants to know how many bloaters they pulled in last month!
